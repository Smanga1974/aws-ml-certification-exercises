## 📊 Projects & ML Exercises

### 🏠 Supervised Learning – Predicting Building Energy Efficiency
- Trained a `RandomForestRegressor` to predict energy efficiency from building features
- Visualized feature relationships
- Evaluated with Mean Squared Error and prediction scatter plots  
📂 [`supervised_learning/energy_efficiency.ipynb`](supervised_learning/energy_efficiency.ipynb)

---

### 🚗 Unsupervised Learning – Vehicle Clustering
- Used `KMeans` to cluster vehicles by engine size, weight, and horsepower
- Visualized clusters in 2D with Matplotlib  
📂 [`unsupervised_learning/vehicle_clustering.ipynb`](unsupervised_learning/vehicle_clustering.ipynb)
