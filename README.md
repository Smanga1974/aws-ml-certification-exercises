# 🤖 Generative AI with AWS – Machine Learning Exercises

This repository showcases hands-on projects and exercises completed during the **"Introducing Generative AI with AWS"** course on AWS Skill Builder.

It includes practical applications of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The exercises use synthetic data to simulate real-world problems.

## 🌐 PartyRock App – WellnessWise

I built a generative AI wellness assistant app on [PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws/u/Smangaliso/i7guYJscW/WellnessWise).

> **WellnessWise** is a generative AI-powered health and wellness advisor. Users input details about their lifestyle and receive recommendations for:
> - Nutrition 🍎  
> - Exercise 🏋️  
> - Sleep 😴  
> - Hydration 💧  
> - Stress management 🧘  

**Note:** This app offers general wellness advice and is not a replacement for professional healthcare.

## 📊 Projects & ML Exercises

### 🏠 Supervised Learning – Predicting Building Energy Efficiency
- Trained a `RandomForestRegressor` to predict energy efficiency from building features.
- Visualized pairwise feature relationships.
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error and prediction scatter plot.
📂 `supervised_learning/energy_efficiency.ipynb`

---

### 🚗 Unsupervised Learning – Vehicle Clustering
- Used `KMeans` to cluster vehicles based on engine size, weight, and horsepower.
- Visualized clusters in 2D using Matplotlib.
📂 `unsupervised_learning/vehicle_clustering.ipynb`

---

### 📉 Decision Tree – Predicting Customer Churn
- Built a `DecisionTreeClassifier` using synthetic telecom data.
- Achieved accuracy measurement.
- Visualized the decision tree using `sklearn.tree.plot_tree`.
📂 `decision_tree/customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`

---

### 🧠 Neural Network – Purchase Prediction
- Built a small neural net using `TensorFlow`/`Keras`.
- Predicts customer purchase behavior based on visit duration and number of pages visited.
- Used sigmoid activation for binary classification.
